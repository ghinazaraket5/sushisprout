        <h1>Sushi Sprout Story</h1>
        <p>
            Many years ago, in a bustling harbor town in China, there was a small, family-run restaurant known as The Lantern’s Glow. Each evening, the family would light a single red lantern outside their door, signaling to hungry sailors and townsfolk that the kitchen was open.
            
            The restaurant was famous for its harmony of flavors, crafted with secret recipes passed down for generations. It was said that the red lantern carried a blessing: whoever dined beneath its glow would find warmth, joy, and a sense of home, no matter where they came from.
            
            Today, we continue that tradition. At <span id=resto>Sushi Sprout</span>, every dish is made with care and tradition, inspired by the flavors of the past and crafted for the moments we share.
            
            <span id=highlight>Step into the glow and let us share our story with you—one dish at a time.</span></p>
